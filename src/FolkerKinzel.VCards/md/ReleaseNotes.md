- Supports RFC 6868 parameter value encoding in vCard 4.0
- Fixes an issue that the properties `FBURL`, `CALURI`, `CAPURI`, and `CALADRURI` in vCard 3.0 might have a 
PREF parameter whose TYPE parameter name is missing. (This was caused by an [error in RFC 2739](https://www.rfc-editor.org/errata/eid7914)).
- Fixes an issue that the `MediaType` of a "data" URL could not be parsed correctly in vCard 4.0 if masking had been applied to the "data" URL.
